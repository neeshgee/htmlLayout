      <h1>The History of Web Design</h1>
        <h3>(in my opinion of course!)</h3>
      <p>It's pretty hard for me to believe that <em>web design</em> started off as
    a black screen back in 1989. While it is hard for me to believe the past of
    web design, it is not hard for me to be amazed to see where it all began and
    to compare it to where web design is now.</p>
  <p>From the evolution of web browsers starting in 1995 using tables inside of
    tables to JavaScript being introduced along with Flash and CSS. The evolution
    didn't just stop at those listed above but web design continued to evolve and
    get better and better with time. Enhancing the viewers experience on the web
    and also making it easier for web designers to creat projects appealing to
    the eye.</p><br><br>
  <p>Considering how far web design as come I can only imagine what is in store
    for the future. Improvements are constantly being made to improve the experience
    in web desing and web browsing. I look forward to the future improvements and
    I am super excited to be entering a career with such rewarding advancement
    that I will be able to incorporate into my everyday work. Since the beginning
    web design and its advancement has only gotten better and that's exactly how
    I see it for the future!</p></main>
